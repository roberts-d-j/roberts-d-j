My name is Dylan Roberts (he/him). I am a longtime audio engineer and aspiring programmer, with experience in many aspects of media production. I enjoy many creative pursuits, and I am excited for the future that coding will bring. I look forward to the potential applications that coding knowledge will bring to my personal and professional lives. 

I am entering Tech Elevator's full stack coding bootcamp as a student. I hope to find meaningful work within the field as I grow my skillset and portfolio. 

In addition to starting my developing journey, I have a long history creating music of myriad genres, and actively work on several other creative passions including an indie tabletop roleplaying game.
