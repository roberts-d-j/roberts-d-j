My name is Dylan Roberts (he/him). I am a longtime audio engineer and programmer, with experience in many aspects of media production. I enjoy many creative pursuits, and I am excited for the future that coding will bring. I look forward to the potential applications that coding knowledge will bring to my personal and professional lives. 

I attended Tech Elevator's full stack coding bootcamp and graduated October 2023. I am currently a Technical Consultant working with SnowFox Solutions on the ServiceNow platform. 

In addition to software and web dev, I have a long history creating music of myriad genres, and actively work on several other creative passions including an indie tabletop roleplaying game.
